# Stardew Valley Perfection Randomizer

The Randomizer is a Stardew Valley challenge, originally created by
[ArgonMatrix]("https://www.youtube.com/@ArgonMatrix"), where the goal
is to complete Perfection - one goal at a time, in a randomly decided order!

The original version was made in Google Docs as a spreadsheet,
but I wanted there to be a more accessible, more performant,
better looking version, so I made this.

If you're interested in starting a Randomizer challenge,
you can use the version of the app
[published here](https://mabi.tmpinc.io/stardew-perfection-randomizer/).
